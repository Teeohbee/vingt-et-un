# vingt-et-un

A basic game of Blackjack or Twenty One, written in Ruby and served up with a little help from Sinatra

## Purpose

This project began life as a pairing test I was practicing, the original development and commits of which can be found [here](https://github.com/Teeohbee/pairing-tests/tree/master/21s). After getting the basic game structure and methods in place, I wanted to extend the game to include a front-end and UI, so decided to extract the core game code here and create a new repo focused on getting a full web app going.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/Teeohbee/vingt-et-un.git`
2. `cd vingt-et-un`
3. `bundle install`

## Tests

4. `rspec`
